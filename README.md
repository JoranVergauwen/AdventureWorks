# AdventureWorks


Hi there! 

This repo was made to serve as a basic analysis of the AdventureWorks dataset by Microsoft. 

The "Data Exploration" notebook contains some very basic exploration of some of the data files. 
No special formatting was done when creating the output, because this was just to get a fast glimpse of the data

The "Basic Analysis" notebook contains some fundamental insights in the dataset. 
This notebook makes use of the "plotting.py" file, which contains some fancy plotting functions. 

Lastly, the "Churn prediction" notebook suggests a very basic churn prediction model. 
This model can be improved by using more predictors, as well as predicting churn for online and offline sales with separate models. 
This is because the online sales tend to have a totally different behaviour after June 2013 (see "Basic Analysis" notebook). 

Furthermore, the "preprocessing.py" and "models.py" are provided to automate the process in a later step. 
However, the steps in the "Churn prediction" notebook still need to be translated to automated pipelines.
